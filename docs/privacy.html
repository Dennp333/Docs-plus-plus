    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. It is Docs++’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you through our app, Docs++.
        <br />
        <br />
        We do not ever ask for your personal information.
        <br />
        <br />
        We do not retain any collected information from you. Docs++ and its developers have no way to know how you are using the app or the code that you are writing. So feel free to write as much spaghetti code as you like.
        <br />
        <br />
        We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, because we have no access to it.
        <br />
        <br />
        You are free to refuse our request for your personal information. Though you may find it difficult to refuse a request that we do not make.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your continued use of our app will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us. This policy is effective as of 8 May 2023.
