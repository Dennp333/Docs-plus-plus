    <h2>2. Use License</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Permission is granted to temporarily download multiple copies of Docs++ per device for personal or commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

                <li>
                    remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Docs++ at any time.

        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>3. Disclaimer</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The materials within Docs++ are provided on an ‘as is’ basis. Docs++ makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

    <h2>4. Limitations</h2>
    <p>
